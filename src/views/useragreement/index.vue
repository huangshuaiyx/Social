        You may purchase different subscription packages, in one-month packets. For all mobile subscriptions, payment will be charged to your iTunes or Google account when you confirm your purchase. Your subscription will renew automatically unless you switch off the auto-renew feature at least 24 hours before the end of your current subscription. IThis is because your account may be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of your current subscription period. You can manage your subscription and switch off auto-renewal by accessing your iTunes or Google account settings. You may not cancel your current subscription during the subscription period, although you may cancel automatic renewal at any time. If you purchase a subscription packet with an introductory price, at renewal you will be charged with the original price which will be higher. If you have already used a free trial you can not use it again and you will be charged the full price. Both Apple and Google may facilitate “50% OFF” of subscription products for first-time users, and we take advantage of that ability. For example, from time to time we offer a free initial week to our first-time VIP subscribers. Eligibility for any such trial is limited to users who have not previously subscribed to our VIP subscription, through either a current or prior Bella account. If you are a previous subscription subscriber and try to claim a discount, you should be aware that Apple or Google may recognize your ineligibility. If so, you may not receive a discount, but instead may be charged immediately for your first subscription month. This is a feature controlled by the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store, depending on which platform you use for our Services. Purchases of Subscriptions are non-refundable and non-transferable, even if they expire or are discontinued.
