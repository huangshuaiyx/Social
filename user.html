            <h4>Terms of Service</h4>
            
            <p>Hey, this is SweetClub! We've drafted these Terms of Service (which we simply call the "Terms") so that
                you'll know the rules that govern our relationship with you. By using the Services, you agree to the
                Terms.</p>
            <p>The following Terms of Service outline your obligations when using our mobile application (“App”) or
                Service (as defined herein), or any of the information, text, graphics, videos, or other files,
                materials, data or content of any kind whatsoever created or provided by or through the App or the
                Service or through your ability to sell products on the App and generate User Contributed Content (as
                defined herein). Please also review our Privacy Policy, which is a part of these Terms of Service and
                which outlines our practices towards handling any personal information that you may provide to us.</p>
            <p>The App and the Service are owned and operated by&nbsp;SweetClub&nbsp;team&nbsp;(“SweetClub,” “we,” or
                “us”) and are accessed by you under the Terms of Service described herein (“Terms of Service” or
                “Agreement”). Please read these Terms of Service carefully before using the App or the Service. By
                accessing the App or using any part of the Service, you agree to become bound by these terms and
                conditions. If you do not agree to all these terms and conditions, then you may not access the App or
                use the Service. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to confer any third party rights or benefits.
            </p>
            <p>ARBITRATION NOTICE: WE WANT TO LET YOU KNOW UPFRONT THAT THESE TERMS CONTAIN AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE A
                LITTLE LATER ON. EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES MENTIONED IN THAT ARBITRATION CLAUSE, YOU AND
                SweetClub&nbsp;AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN US WILL BE RESOLVED BY MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION, AND YOU
                AND SweetClub&nbsp;WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.
            </p>
            
            <h4>1. Who Can Use the Services</h4>
            <p>No one under 18 is allowed to create an account or use the Services. We may offer additional Services
                with additional terms that may require you to be even older to use them. So please read all terms
                carefully.</p>
            <p>By using the Services, you state that:</p>
            <p>- You can form a binding contract with SweetClub;</p>
            <p>- You will comply with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws,
                rules, and regulations.</p>
            <p>If you are using the Services on behalf of a business or some other entity, you state that you are
                authorized to grant all licenses set forth in these Terms and to agree to these Terms on behalf of the
                business or entity. </p>
            <p>No one under 18 is allowed to create an account or use the Services.</p>
            <p>You hereby warrant that you are at least 18 years old. In the event that the information you provide in
                this regard is not truthful, SweetClub&nbsp;shall not be liable as it cannot verify the age of its
                users. If you are under 18 years old, do not attempt to register or use the App or the Service. If you
                are under the age of 18, you may use the Service, with or without registering, only with the approval of
                your parent or guardian. In addition, you should review these terms with your parent or guardian to make
                sure that you and your parent or guardian understand and agree with these terms.</p>
            
            <h4>2. Rights You Grant Us</h4>
            <p>Many of our Services let you create, upload, post, send, receive, and store content. When you do that,
                you retain whatever ownership rights in that content you had to begin with. But you grant us a license
                to use that content. How broad that license is depends on which Services you use and the Settings you
                have selected.</p>
            <p>For all Services, you grant SweetClub&nbsp;a worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable
                license to host, store, use, display, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, publish, and distribute that
                content. This license is for the limited purpose of operating, developing, providing, promoting, and
                improving the Services and researching and developing new ones.</p>
            <p>Because Local is inherently public and chronicle matters of public interest, the license you grant us for
                content submitted to those Services is broader. In addition to the rights you grant us in connection
                with other Services, you also grant us a perpetual license to create derivative works from, promote,
                exhibit, broadcast, syndicate, publicly perform, and publicly display content submitted to Local or any
                other crowd-sourced Services in any form and in any and all media or distribution methods (now known or
                later developed). To the extent it's necessary, you also grant SweetClub&nbsp;and our business partners
                the unrestricted, worldwide, perpetual right and license to use your name, likeness, Local content that
                you upload or send. This means, among other things, that you will not be entitled to any compensation
                from SweetClub&nbsp;or our business partners if your name, likeness or Local.</p>
            <p>While we're not required to do so, we may access, review, screen, and delete your content at any time and
                for any reason, including if we think your content violates these Terms. You alone though remain
                responsible for the content you create, upload, post, send, or store through the Service.</p>
            <p>The Services may contain advertisements. In consideration for SweetClub&nbsp;letting you access and use
                the Services, you agree that SweetClub, its affiliates, and third-party partners may place advertising
                on the Services.</p>
            <p>We always love to hear from our users. But if you volunteer feedback or suggestions, just know that we
                can use your ideas without compensating you.</p>
            
            <h4>3. Rights We Grant You</h4>
            <p>SweetClub&nbsp;grants you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, nonexclusive, revocable,
                and non-sublicensable license to access and use the Services. This license is for the sole purpose of
                letting you use and enjoy the Service's benefits in a way that these Terms and our usage policies.</p>
            <p>Any software that we provide you may automatically download and install upgrades, updates, or other new
                features. You may be able to adjust these automatic downloads through your device's settings.</p>
            <p>You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our Services, nor may you reverse
                engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless applicable laws prohibit these
                restrictions or you have our written permission to do so.</p>
            
            <h4>4. The Content of Others</h4>
            <p>Much of the content on our Services is produced by users, publishers, and other third parties. Whether
                that content is posted publicly or sent privately, the content is the sole responsibility of the person
                or organization that submitted it. Although SweetClub&nbsp;reserves the right to review all content that
                appears on the Services and to remove any content that violates these Terms, we do not necessarily
                review all of it. So we cannot—and do not—take responsibility for any content that others provide
                through the Services.</p>
            <p>Through these Terms, we make clear that we do not want the Services put to bad uses. But because we do
                not review all content, we cannot guarantee that content on the Services will always conform to our
                Terms.</p>
            <p>We do not endorse, support, represent or guarantee the truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any
                content contributed by users or endorse any of the opinions expressed therein. You agree to waive, and
                hereby do waive, any legal or equitable rights or remedies you have or may have against us with respect
                thereto. You acknowledge that any reliance on User Contributed Content of any SweetClub&nbsp;user will
                be at your own risk.</p>
            
            <h4>5. Privacy</h4>
            <p>Your privacy matters to us. You can learn how we handle your information when you use our Services by
                reading our privacy policy. We encourage you to give the privacy policy a careful look because, by using
                our Services, you agree that SweetClub&nbsp;can collect, use, and transfer your information consistent
                with that policy.</p>
            <h4>6. Respecting Other People's Rights</h4>
            <p>SweetClub&nbsp;respects the rights of others. And so should you. You therefore may not upload, send, or
                store content that:</p>

                intellectual-property right;</p>

                pornographic, hateful, or promotes violence, discrimination, bigotry, racism, or hatred, as determined
                by SweetClub&nbsp;in its sole discretion;</p>
            <p>- introduces viruses, time-bombs, worms, cancelbots, Trojan horses and/or other harmful code, - is
                reverse look-up or trace any information of any other User or visitor or otherwise use the Services for
                the purpose of obtaining information of any User or visitor;</p>
            <p>- attempts to gain unauthorized access to any portion of the Services, or any systems or networks by
                hacking, password "mining" or any other illegitimate means;</p>

                any data or materials contained therein or obtain or attempt to obtain any materials, documents or

                violates these terms.</p>
            <p>You must also respect SweetClub's rights. These Terms do not grant you any right to:</p>
            <p>- use branding, logos, designs, photographs, videos, or any other materials used in our Services;</p>
            <p>- copy, archive, download, upload, distribute, syndicate, broadcast, perform, display, make available, or
                otherwise use any portion of the Services or the content on the Services except as set forth in these
                Terms;</p>
            <p>- use the Services or any content on the Services for any commercial purposes without our consent.</p>
            <p>In short: You may not use the Services or the content on the Services in ways that are not authorized by
                these Terms. Nor may you help or enable anyone else in doing so.</p>
            <p>We reserve the right at all times (but will not have an obligation) to remove or refuse to distribute any
                content contributed by SweetClub&nbsp;users, such as content which violates these Terms of Service. We
                also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe
                is necessary to :</p>
            <p>- enforce these Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations hereof;</p>

                and the public.</p>
            <p>We will not be responsible or liable for the exercise or non-exercise of this right under these Terms of
                Service.</p>
            <p>You understand that by using or accessing the App or the Service you may be exposed to content that might
                be offensive, harmful, inaccurate or otherwise inappropriate material, or in some cases, postings that
                have been mislabeled or are otherwise deceptive. Under no circumstances will we be liable in any way for
                any content or communications, including, but not limited to, any errors or omissions in any form of
                User Contributed Content, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any
                SweetClub&nbsp;content or content posted by users which are posted, emailed, transmitted or otherwise
                made available on the App or through the Service.</p>
            
            <h4>7. Respecting Copyright</h4>
            <p>You agree to only upload, post, submit or otherwise transmit User Contributed Content: (i) that you have
                the lawful right to use, copy, distribute, transmit, or display; and (ii) that does not infringe the
                intellectual property rights or violate the privacy rights of any third party (including, without
                limitation, copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, or other intellectual property right, or moral
                right or right of publicity). SweetClub&nbsp;respects the legal rights of others, and asks that its
                users do the same.</p>
            <p>SweetClub&nbsp;honors the requirements set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. We therefore
                take reasonable steps to expeditiously remove from our Services any infringing material that we become
                aware of. And if SweetClub&nbsp;becomes aware that one of its users has repeatedly infringed copyrights,
                we will take reasonable steps within our power to terminate the user's account.</p>
            <p>If you file a notice with our Copyright Agent, must:</p>
            <p>- contain the physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the copyright
                owner;</p>
            <p>- provide your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email address;</p>
            <p>- identify the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed;</p>
            <p>- identify the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and
                that is to be removed, or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to
                let us locate the material;</p>
            <p>- provide a personal statement that you have a good-faith belief that the use of the material in the
                manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and</p>
            <p>- provide a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury,
                that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.</p>
            
            <h4>8. Safety</h4>
            <p>We try hard to keep our Services a safe place for all users. But we can't guarantee it. That's where you
                come in. By using the Services, you agree that:</p>
            <p>- You will not use the Services for any purpose that is illegal or prohibited in these Terms.</p>
            <p>- You will not use any robot, spider, crawler, scraper, or other automated means or interface to access
                the Services or extract other user's information.</p>
            <p>- You will not use or develop any third-party applications that interact with the Services or other
                users' content or information without our written consent.</p>
            <p>- You will not use the Services in a way that could interfere with, disrupt, negatively affect, or
                inhibit other users from fully enjoying the Services, or that could damage, disable, overburden, or
                impair the functioning of the Services.</p>
            <p>- You will not use or attempt to use another user's account, username, or password without their
                permission.</p>
            <p>- You will not solicit login credentials from another user.</p>
            <p>- You will not post content that contains pornography, graphic violence, threats, hate speech, guns or
                other weaponry, or incitements to violence.</p>
            <p>- You will not attempt to circumvent any content-filtering techniques we employ, or attempt to access
                areas or features of the Services that you are not authorized to access.</p>
            <p>- You will not probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of our Services or any system or network.</p>
            <p>- You will not encourage or promote any activity that violates these Terms.</p>
            <p>- You will not upload viruses or other malicious code or otherwise compromise the security of the
                Services.</p>
            <p>We have the right to investigate and prosecute violations of any of the above, including intellectual
                property rights infringement and App security issues, to the fullest extent of the law. We may involve
                and cooperate with law enforcement authorities in prosecuting SweetClub&nbsp;users who violate these
                Terms of Service. You acknowledge that we have the right to monitor your access to or use of the App
                and/or the Service for operating purposes, to ensure your compliance with these Terms of Service, or to
                comply with applicable law or the order or requirement of a court, administrative agency or other
                governmental body.</p>
            <p>We also care about your safety while using our Services. So do not use our Services in a way that would
                distract you from obeying traffic or safety laws. And never put yourself or others in harm's way.</p>
            
            <h4>9. Your Account</h4>
            <p>You are responsible for any activity that occurs in your account. So it's important that you keep your
                account secure. One way to do that is to select a strong password that you don't use for any other
                account.</p>
            <p>By using the Services, you agree that, in addition to exercising common sense:</p>
            <p>- You will not create more than one account for yourself.</p>
            <p>- You will not buy, sell, rent, or lease access to your SweetClub&nbsp;account without our written
                permission.</p>
            <p>- You will not share your password.</p>
            <p>- You will not create another account if we have already disabled your account, unless you have our
                written permission to do so.</p>
            <p>- You will not log in or attempt to access the Services through unauthorized third-party applications or
                clients.</p>
            
            <h4>10. Purchases and Payments</h4>
            <p>We may offer various friends making Services that you can purchase and use through the Services. You
                don't own these Services; instead you buy enough app gems to use them. You'll always be shown the price
                for Services before you complete a purchase. But SweetClub&nbsp;does not handle payments or payment
                processing for any purchases; those are handled by third-party payment providers or service providers
                (such as, Apple's iOS Store and Google's Google Play Store, among others). Some third-party service
                providers may charge you sales tax, depending on where you live. Please check the third-party service
                provider's relevant terms for details.</p>
            <p>Subject to any applicable additional terms and conditions, all purchases are final and non-refundable.
                And because our performance begins once you tap buy and we give you immediate access to your purchase,
                you waive any right you may have under EU or other local law to cancel your purchase once it's completed
                or to get a refund. BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS, YOU AGREE THAT SweetClub&nbsp;IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A
                REFUND FOR ANY REASON.</p>
            <p>Some of the Virtual Products we offer are for one-time use only, while others are for repeated use. But
                please note that "repeated" does not mean "forever." We may change, modify, or eliminate Virtual
                Products at any time, with or without notice. You agree that we will bear no liability to you or any
                third party if we do so. If we suspend or terminate your account, you will lose any Products you
                purchased through the Services.</p>
            <p>If your SweetClub&nbsp;account remains inactive for 3 consecutive months, all of your free virtual Coins
                may be frozen. To unfreeze any such virtual Coins, you must email us and request that we unfreeze your
                free virtual Coins. Upon receipt of your request and review of your information, we will unfreeze your
                free virtual Coins as soon as possible. You agree that we have the absolute right to manage, distribute,
                regulate, control, modify, or eliminate Coins as we see fit in our sole discretion, and that we will
                have no liability for exercising such right.</p>
            <p>It's your sole responsibility to manage your purchases. If you are under 18 (or younger than the age of
                legal majority in your place of residence), you must obtain your parent's or guardian's consent before
                making any purchases.</p>
            <p>SweetClub&nbsp;does not transmit any funds and is not a money-services business. To the extent such
                functionality is made available in the Services, it is provided by an unaffiliated third party, and like
                any other third-party service, subject to that third party's separate Terms of Service.</p>
            <p>If you subscribed using your Google Play Store account: please contact Google Play customer support with
                your order number for the Google Play Store (you can find the order number in the order confirmation
                email or by logging in to Google Wallet).</p>
            
            <h4>11. Data Charges and Mobile Phones</h4>
            <p>You are responsible for any mobile charges that you may incur for using our Services, including
                text-messaging and data charges. If you're unsure what those charges may be, you should ask your service
                provider before using the Services.</p>
            
            <h4>12. Third-Party Services</h4>
            <p>If you use a service, feature, or functionality that is operated by a third party and made available
                through our Services (including Services we jointly offer with the third party), each party's terms will
                govern the respective party's relationship with you. SweetClub&nbsp;is not responsible or liable for
                those third party's terms or actions taken under the third party's terms.</p>
            
            <h4>13. Modifying the Services and Termination</h4>
            <p>We're relentlessly improving our Services and creating new ones all the time. That means we may add or
                remove features, products, or functionalities, and we may also suspend or stop the Services altogether.
                We may take any of these actions at any time, and when we do, we may not provide you with any notice
                beforehand.</p>
            <p>SweetClub&nbsp;may also terminate these Terms with you at any time, for any reason, and without advanced
                notice. That means that we may stop providing you with any Services, or impose new or additional limits
                on your ability to use the Services. For example, we may deactivate your account due to prolonged
                inactivity or inappropriate behavior, and we may reclaim your username at any time for any reason.</p>
            
            <h4>14. Indemnity</h4>
            <p>You agree, to the extent permitted under applicable law, to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless
                SweetClub, our directors, officers, employees, and affiliates from and against any and all complaints,
                charges, claims, damages, losses, costs, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys' fees) due to,
                arising out of, or relating in any way to: (a) your access to or use of the Services; (b) your content;
                and (c) your breach of these Terms.</p>
            
            <h4>15. Limitation of Liability</h4>
            <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, SweetClub&nbsp;AND OUR MANAGING MEMBERS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES,
                AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, AND SUPPLIERS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
                CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, OR MULTIPLE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED
                DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM:
                (A) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES; (B) THE CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF
                OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICES; OR (C) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE, OR ALTERATION
                OF YOUR CONTENT, EVEN IF SweetClub&nbsp;HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT
                WILL MEET NOW'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICES EXCEED THE GREATER OF $100
                USD OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID SweetClub, IF ANY, IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS.</p>
            <p>SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO SOME OR ALL OF THE
                EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
            
            <h4>16. Disclaimers</h4>
            <p>We try to keep the Services up and running and free of annoyances. But we make no promises that we will
                succeed.</p>
            <p>THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW
                WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED
                WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. IN
                ADDITION, WHILE SweetClub&nbsp;ATTEMPTS TO PROVIDE A GOOD USER EXPERIENCE, WE DO NOT REPRESENT OR
                WARRANT THAT: (A) THE SERVICES WILL ALWAYS BE SECURE, ERROR-FREE, OR TIMELY; (B) THE SERVICES WILL
                ALWAYS FUNCTION WITHOUT DELAYS, DISRUPTIONS, OR IMPERFECTIONS; OR (C) THAT ANY SweetClub&nbsp;CONTENT,
                USER CONTENT, OR INFORMATION YOU OBTAIN ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL BE TIMELY OR ACCURATE.</p>
            <p>SweetClub&nbsp;TAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY AND ASSUMES NO LIABILITY FOR ANY CONTENT THAT YOU, ANOTHER USER,
                OR A THIRD PARTY CREATES, UPLOADS, POSTS, SENDS, RECEIVES, OR STORES ON OR THROUGH OUR SERVICES. YOU
                UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU MAY BE EXPOSED TO CONTENT THAT MIGHT BE OFFENSIVE, ILLEGAL, MISLEADING, OR
                OTHERWISE INAPPROPRIATE, NONE OF WHICH SweetClub&nbsp;WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR.</p>
            
            <h4>17. Arbitration, Class Waiver, and Jury Waiver</h4>
            <p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH
                SweetClub, AND LIMIT THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.</p>
            <p>- Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. All claims and disputes arising out of or relating to these
                Terms or the use of the Services that cannot be resolved in small claims court will be resolved by
                binding arbitration on an individual basis, except that you and SweetClub&nbsp;are not required to
                arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of
                copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents.</p>
            <p>- Authority of the Arbitrator. The arbitrator will decide the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the
                rights and liabilities, if any, of you and SweetClub. The dispute will not be consolidated with any
                other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant
                motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to
                award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under
                applicable law, the arbitral forum's rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator will issue a written award and
                statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based,
                including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief
                on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final
                and binding upon you and SweetClub.</p>
            <p>- Additional Rules for Non-appearance Arbitration. If non-appearance arbitration is elected, the
                arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online, written submissions, or any combination of the
                three; the specific manner will be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration will
                not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless the parties mutually agree
                otherwise.</p>
            <p>- Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION
                AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF
                MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF
                ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If, however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid
                or unenforceable, neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration.</p>
            <p>- Right to Waive. Any rights and limitations set forth in this arbitration agreement may be waived by the
                party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver will not waive or affect any other portion of this
                arbitration agreement.</p>
            <p>- Opt-out. You may opt out of this arbitration agreement. If you do so, neither you nor
                SweetClub&nbsp;can force the other to arbitrate. To opt out, you must notify SweetClub&nbsp;in writing
                no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to this arbitration agreement. Your notice must
                include your name and address, your SweetClub&nbsp;username and the email address you used to set up
                your SweetClub&nbsp;account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt-out of
                this arbitration agreement.</p>
            <p>- Confidentiality. No part of the procedures will be open to the public or the media. All evidence
                discovered or submitted at the hearing is confidential and may not be disclosed, except by written
                agreement of the parties, pursuant to court order, or unless required by law. Notwithstanding the
                foregoing, no party will be prevented from submitting to a court of law any information needed to
                enforce this arbitration agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable
                relief.</p>
            <p>- Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or SweetClub&nbsp;may bring an individual
                action in small claims court.</p>
            <p>- Arbitration Agreement Survival. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your
                relationship with SweetClub.</p>
            
            <h4>18. Additional Terms for Specific Services</h4>
            <p>Given the breadth of our Services, we sometimes need to craft additional terms and conditions for
                specific Services. Those additional terms and conditions, which will be available with the relevant
                Services, then become part of your agreement with us if you use those Services.</p>
            
            <h4>19. Severability</h4>
            <p>If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, then that provision will be severed from these
                Terms and not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>
            
            <h4>20. Choice of Law</h4>
            <p>Except to the extent they are preempted by the laws of Hong Kong, other than its conflict-of-laws
                principles, govern these Terms and any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or their
                subject matter, including tort claims.</p>
            
            <h4>21. Final Terms</h4>
            <p>- These Terms make up the entire agreement between you and SweetClub, and supersede any prior agreements.
            </p>
            <p>- These Terms do no create or confer any third-party beneficiary rights.</p>
            <p>- We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.</p>
            <p>- You may not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without our consent.</p>
            <p>- If we do not enforce a provision in these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver.</p>
            <p>- These Terms were written in English and to the extent the translated version of these Terms conflict
                with the English version, the English version will control.</p>
